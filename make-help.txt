                   Entropy-Emacs Make

Welcom to Entropy-Emacs Make procedure, there's four core 'make'
options provision that 'install', 'install-coworkers','update' and
'dump', for each as install all elisp packges, install external
depedencies and prompting for updaing packags and dumping emacs, or
doing thus all using 'all' option, dump option for just dumping
current eemacs status (notice for using 'install' operation firstly
for check requirements dependencies or using 'all' operation dismiss
the mistake steps instead).

Example:

       make all
       make install
       make install-coworkers
       make update
       make dump
       make native-comp

- 'native-comp' option will using gccemacs 'native-compile' func to
  compile all packages hosted in `package-user-dir'. It's useful when
  you use gccemacs.

- 'install-coworkers' option will install all system-wide emacs
  dependencies where entropy-emacs specified, you will do it when
  you're missing any of libraries prompt internally of entropy-emacs
  using.

The dumped emacs binary file is stored in
'entropy/emacs-user-emacs-directory' (i.e. the entropy-emacs specified
`user-emacs-directory' and be equivalent to it in most of cases) with
name-space as 'eemacs_YearDateTime.pdmp', start it with:

-------
       emacs --dump-file=eemacs_YearDateTime.pdmp
-------
