- State "HANGUP"     from "MARKING"    [2019-07-29 Mon 18:44] \\
  Has patched by specific 'kill-buffer' action, waiting for bug reply
  from emacs-bug-mailist.


*Bug description:*

If using the modeline who using all-the-icons as the segments'
component, that when using pop-up window to show 'ansi-term' will
cause the problem during 'kill-buffer' operation for the spawn process
kill confirmation returns the error for that:

``` error-info
Debugger entered--Lisp error: (error "Selecting deleted buffer")
term-emulate-terminal(#<process *ansi-term*> "your-shell-$ps1")
```
But when you using the 'y-or-n-p' redefine the 'yes-or-no-p', its
gone.

The bug trigger also referred to font setting that if using some fonts
specific (e.g. liberation-mono fonts) unless the google-noto family
will get the error when the 'yes-or-no-p' redefination not did as
demoted in above paragraph.

*Bug Reproduce:*

1) Operation Environment:

   Platform: GNU/Linux
   Distro: Manjaro (4.19.60-1-MANJARO GNU/Linux)
   Emacs-Version: 26.x all serial
   Emacs Configuration: Vanilla

2) Put below elisp snippet into `init.el`

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (package-initialize)
     (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
     (setq package-archives '(("gnu"   . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                              ("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/")
                              ("org"   . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")))

     ;; Please install 'liberation-ttf' first
     (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Liberation Mono" :font "Liberation Mono")

     (defun temp/test-bug ()
       (interactive)
       (when (not (one-window-p))
         (delete-other-windows)
         (about-emacs))
       (let ((_w (split-window
                  (selected-window)
                  25
                  'below)))
         (select-window _w)
         (ansi-term "bash")
         (setq-local kill-buffer-hook nil)))

     (global-set-key (kbd "<f9>") #'temp/test-bug)

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x k") 'kill-buffer-and-window)

     (unless (package-installed-p 'doom-modeline)
       (package-refresh-contents)
       (package-install 'doom-modeline))

     (doom-modeline-mode)
   #+END_SRC

3) Start emacs and hit '<f9>', then try to kill the selected buffer

   Notice: the "yes-or-no" input string must type correcly at the firt
   input time, otherwise the bug reproduce will not did as expecting.

1) Bug description:

The emacs session of pdumper loaded type can not covering solaire-mode
feature fully, the solaired buffer has no significant color rendering
efficient, that the solaired buffer has the same color face as the
non-solaired buffer.

1) Influences aspects suspects

   1) Pdumper session lost some features relied by ~solaire-mode~.
   2) This must try another way to configured ~solaire-mode~ with
      pdumper session.


Resolutions:

Its because of that the function ~solaire-mode-swap-bg~ can not used
in theme after procedure hook, in eemacs like
=entropy/emacs-theme-load-after-hook=, its may be a bug that the we
should do the ~solaire-mode-swap-bg~ operation using the idle timer.

*Bug description: *

#+begin_example
Hi hydra maintainer:

I've temporary define a hydra on vanilla emacs env (27.0.90):

(defhydra temp/hydra
  (:hint nil :exit nil :foreign-keys nil)
  "

 temp/hydra

 Common Insert^^
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 _C-c C-,_: Insert a block structure of the type #+begin_foo/#+end_foo
"
  ("C-c C-," org-insert-structure-template :exit t))

With follow warning:
Warning (emacs): Unrecognized key: foo/#+end

Its the bug when the key notation part contained '_' char, is that the ruby doc format limitation which can not using the underscore char in the key notation part (just can used in key stroke region)? Or is their a backslash escape like method to avoid thats strange doc defination?

I known this issue was strained, but what I want is let 'hydra' be more stronger smiley , hope for your help.

Thanks for your greate contribution!

This is a bug for treemacs that enable `lsp-configure-buffer' while
`treemacs-follow-mode' is t at the same time, the overlay markers in
treemacs buffer which will cause definitely internal error for the
usage for treemacs after thus, including any face rendering and
operations expecting the correct of overlay marks.

Further more, this bug will may also raise up an strange bug that the
point in treemacs buffer will jump to buffer top when typiing in an
lsp enabled buffer.

For now [2021-01-08 Fri 23:31:17] there's one temporally fixed up
solution that temporally disable =treemacs-follow-mode= before lsp
enable in certain buffer, and then reenable it after thus.

NOTE: may need to report to treemacs author.

Related to bug ->
https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui/issues/530#issuecomment-762305991

this will make lsp-ui-doc frame freeze emacs while `mwheel-scroll'
down to the eobp of lsp-doc-buffer.

#+begin_quote
Of counse, the issue is referred to an monuse-wheel problem, after
view hours investigating lsp-ui-doc source where I can not judge the
problem sticker yet but finally focus on one emacs customization: the
mouse-wheel-scroll-amount variable which is the pain for thus did
occur on :

You can set it with (setq mouse-wheel-scroll-amount '(1 ((shift)
. 1))) while the amount default is 5, but many user including me set
it to 1 or any other value less than 5 for the sake of "smooth
scrolling" , Uh.. , the freezing occurred.

This may an emacs internal bug, but I can not ensure that is it,
because, it didn't occurred in the stable version of `lsp-ui' , just
after we use the more mordern doc buffer renderring mechanism, is it?

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-467a7c85-5c2b-4d84-97f4-82eb8f1cc418

This caused by both of above and follow:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq mouse-wheel-progressive-speed nil)
#+END_SRC

Thus for now we can built the reproducible template via vanilla emacs:

[[file:lsp-ui-bug530.el][lsp-ui-bug530.el]]

Run it with:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
emacs -q -l lsp-ui-bug530.el
#+END_SRC

With manually hover reproduced of:
#+begin_quote
Please hover the mounse on the symbol `scanf' or `main' on test.c
buffer thens scroll the lsp-ui-doc frame window by mounse-wheel,
then the bug will be occurred with freezing session, and beeping
sequentially while emacs bell ring is not null.

If the bug not occurred try enter <f11> let emacs judging into
fullscreen and redo above section, this may occurred as well.

** TODO emacs internal api =looking-back= freeze emacs
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

This bug caused from an =company-dabbrev-char-regexp= setting of
regexp "[-_/a-zA-Z0-9]+", then the company's dabbrev backend will
invoke the =looking-back= subrouine to determine its matching scope
which used in function =company-grab= which invoked by function
=company-dabbrev--prefix=.

It seems related to the =looking-back= performance issue which
discussed [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/12742/looking-back-performance][here]]. But since we used *LIMIT* optional in the invocation,
it still lag on, which I'd thought its an emacs bug.

The simple reputation can be calling an simple =ivy-read= context:
#+begin_src elisp
  (ivy-read "input sth: "
            '("a" "b"))
#+end_src
Run above code and =\C-r= to trigger the ~ivy-reverse-i-search~ the
input any code and =RET= trigger ~ivy-done~ then the error occurred
(note: please toggle on debug to see the details).

For now mine temporally fixed method is to assign the =require-match=
to its subroutine which forcely ignore any non-matched selection.

** TODO bug of `run-with-idle-timer' with 0 idle delay in emacs start up time
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h-6d28b926-88c0-4286-a0de-9ee7b4a7516c
:END:

When emacs is startup with an idle timer as end procedure in
=init.el=, then there're two pre-typed char =[= and =I= are preformed
into the echo area of that timer.

- Reproduce: [[file:0-idle-delay-init-bug/][here]]

  We can not reproduce in arbitary environment, since it seems related
  to the shell env the emacs start at, espacially in tmux session.

- Temporally resolve dealing: set the idle delay closed to 0 but not
  approach to it.

** log: [2021-09-25 Sat 22:03:52]:

It seems that the idle delay less than 0.001 also will trigger this
bug.

** log: [2021-10-01 Fri 23:13:38]

It seems related to X11 protocal on linux of gnome DE since it
disappeared while using Xwayland gnome session.
