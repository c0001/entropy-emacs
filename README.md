For see full documents of the introduction of `entropy-emacs` please see [here](elements/site-lisp/entropy-emacs-doc/org/entropy-emacs_introduction.md).

**Extensions:**

`entropy-emacs` using various third-party extensions from [elpa](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/), [melpa](https://melpa.org), and some ones hosted on gihtub.com, thus most of them are not wrapped within this repo, for reason of module aspect management. There's one main corresponding project tied with `entropy-emacs` for as the archive of current using extensions collection: ([entropy-emacs-extensions](https://github.com/c0001/entropy-emacs-extensions)), for see its explicit meaning, see the commentary of [entropy-emacs-ext.el](elements/core/baron/summon/entropy-emacs-ext.el), and it's the stable(tested) extensions that entropy-emacs used for, it has its own host-server procedure which forked from '[melpa](https://melpa.org/)' to produce as what it means. You must make it before using it and make understanding by following its README or just install its stable release using the `make` section of `eemacs` (see the make eemacs secion below).

For case using by self downloading `entropy-emacs-extension` in a released `entropy-emacs`, there's a version limit restriction usage for this case that each eemacs release was followed a version of `entropy-emacs-extension` release or the release referred updates version follow the "x.y.z" version naming convention, you should download the `entropy-emacs-extension` release which case this case specified.

Or on the most used occasion, you don't need to retrieve that eemacs extension release project, just using the melpa **up-to-date** upstream but may have compatible problem with current eemacs release version, if that, please using eemacs git repo as your eemacs configuration workspace host to track update with `dev` branch, this may solve various compatible issue or kick one issue on [eemacs issue page](https://github.com/c0001/entropy-emacs/issues) for querying/asking on a resolution.

For switch this two extension usage type, the variable `entropy/emacs-ext-elpkg-customized-get-type` are given for customization, the default type was using melpa upstream to give the default ignorance to individually `entropy-emacs-extension` resources retrieving trouble, but in this case should notice the above mentioned compatible issues.

For use `entropy-emacs-extensions`, put this

```emacs-lisp
    (setq entropy/emacs-ext-elpkg-customized-get-type 'entropy-emacs-extenisons-project)
```

to your `custom.el` and then run


```shell
    make install-eemacs-ext-build
```

in eemacs configuration root host. (the eemacs `make` facilities please see below section)

**Make entropy-emacs**

entropy-emacs use GnuMakefile to initialize with rich facilities for the sake of stick on eemacs internal mechanism.

You can run `make help` to see the details in eemacs configuration host root path.

**TIPS:**

1.  emacs hang and can not handle terminate using `C-g`?

    Try using `pgrep` to find the process id of current emacs session and then run `kill -s SIGUSR2 pid` to trigger the emacs internal terminate handle.
