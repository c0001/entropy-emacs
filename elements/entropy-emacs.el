;; This project building the variable definitions which contains both
;; of the =customizable= and =static const= cases, even for the
;; internal temporal ones, all of them categorized into following
;; files:
;;
;; 1) `entropy-emacs-defconst':  the static const variables
;; 2) `entropy-emacs-defvar':    the pacakge internal sharing variables.
;;
;; The above two variable-defined package are requiring each other in
;; the shown order, that says the =defcustom= are the top requirements
;; for =defconst=, and =defconst= was the dependency for =defvar=, in
;; the reason for as that =defconst= and =defvar='s content may be
;; initialized with user customization.
;;
;; There's another var-bind type for emacs that the 'face' type, in
;; =entropy-emacs= they are registerred in
;; `entropy-emacs-defface.el'.
