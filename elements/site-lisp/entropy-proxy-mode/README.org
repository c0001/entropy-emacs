* Commentary:

Using global-mode =entropy/proxy-mode= to toggle proxy type for
emacs internal proxy tunnel.

There's three way for setting proxy client within emacs itself:

1. The uri way of http proxy (built-in)
2. Environment variable 'http_proxy'
3. Socks way powered by =socks.el= (built-in)


Setting the individually for customized variables:

1. =entropy/proxy-mode-url-proxy=
2. =entropy/proxy-mode-http-proxy=
3. =entropy/proxy-mode-socks-proxy=

See their default value assignment for form defination.
