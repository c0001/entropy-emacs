This is the sicp texi format offline doc archive, eemacs place it here
since emacser are also an programmer in which case every user of
eemacs may curious about more of computer science.

Originally the sicp doc is obey the [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ ][creativecommons(cc)]] copyright as
freedom document which you can found it in
https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/, and then I found the texi format in
[[https://github.com/GHolk/sicp][this github repo]] where is commented its source is getted from [[http://www.neilvandyke.org/sicp-texi/][here]].

The [[file:Makefile][Makefile]] under this folder is used to generate further more doc
type of the source.

Happy with reading.
