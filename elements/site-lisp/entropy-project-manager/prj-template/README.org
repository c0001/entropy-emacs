*This project was the template for all projects structed as
Entropy-project dir structor.*

* What is Entropy-project
  
For widely concept, Entropy-project reconganizes each project as one
folder which can contain arbitray things whatever your want to adding
into.

For detailes layout for commonly constant of series project folder
containing struct, Entropy-projects was the kind of this folder struct
as for it.

* Dir struct for Entropy-project

Whatever which project's natural meaning, each project must contained
doc for introducting to other people or the coperation partner what
this project is. Entropy-project main has the =org= directory at the
root of current project folder for storing the description or
introduction docs.

*Why named 'org' for the doc folder:*

For mostly using daily of my own workflow, I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] be the project
management and doc source editor, while [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]] was the famous
plain-text typescript format for buiding docs or doing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate
programming]], the greatest of Org-Mode was it can be convert to various
doc format because plain-text nature of it and various built-in
transfer pasers of it(e.g. org2latex ...), which you don't worry about
the multi-convert-of-one-format rather than as the occurrence what
microsoft-doc encoutered.

Secondly, Entropy-project recognizes each part of current project (or
called the elements) as element of current project, and put all of
them under folder =elements= which under the root of project
folder. =elements= folder also can contained the sub-project which
structed as Entropy-project.

Finally, Entropy-project allow the miscellaneous things included in
project folder and put them in =annex= folder which under the root of
current project folder, name of this folder as meaning what was
*annex*. Defaultly Entropy-project contained all doc images under
=annex= folder's subfolder =annex/img= .

* Comprehensive dir struct view: 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  .
  ├── annex
  │   ├── img
  │   └── readme.org
  ├── elements
  │   └── readme.org
  └── org
      └── index.org
#+END_EXAMPLE

*  How using this =Entropy-project= template:

Basically, this template is folder based without any actually
executable aim, thus using it is meant by the workflow, below are some
one recommended to you.

** Using [[https://github.com/c0001/entropy-emacs][entropy-emacs]]:
 
[[https://github.com/c0001/entropy-emacs][Entropy-emacs]] was the emacs configs of my own but not limit for
personal using that was designed for hoping to be community driven
project. =Entropy-emacs= contained the extension called
=entropy-project-manager= which self-contained this template while you
create one new project by calling ~(entropy/prj-add-project)~.

Although emacs package =entropy-project-manager= was distributing only
with =Entropy-emacs=, but it is independent emacs package which can be
extracted for user using, you can download [[https://github.com/c0001/entropy-project-manager.git][entropy-project-manager]] and
it's requirments e.g. =entropy-common-library= which all can be
founded on github, and load them into your emacs =load-path=.

When using =entropy-project-manager=, it will using this template as
default new-adding created form.

** Manually using

For using this =Entropy-project= manually just copy it to wherever you
wanted.

** Template [[file:org/index.org][index.org]]:

This is the only template file of this template folder, as what you
seeing, it's a org file with default template header insert:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
  # -*- mode: org; -*-
  ,#+TITLE: xxx
  ,#+AUTHOR: xxx
  ,#+EMAIL: xxx@xxx.com
  ,#+OPTIONS:   H:3 num:t   toc:3 \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:nil -:t f:t *:t <:nil
  ,#+OPTIONS:   author:t creator:t timestamp:t email:t
  ,#+DESCRIPTION: Put this org file description here
  ,#+KEYWORDS:  key1 key2 key3 key4
  ,#+INFOJS_OPT: view:nil toc:t ltoc:t mouse:underline buttons:0 path:http://orgmode.org/org-info.js
  ,#+EXPORT_SELECT_TAGS: export
  ,#+EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS: noexport
#+END_SRC

You can replace each key's value above shown such as ~#+title: xxx~ to
"Hello world".

Each header keys meaning you can check the org-mode manual section
[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-settings.html][<export-setting>]] .
