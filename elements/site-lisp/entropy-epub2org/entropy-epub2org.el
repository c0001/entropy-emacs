;;; Commentary:
;;
;; For emacs user, the native vision of the getting style of reading
;; ebooks was originally tends to the method which be based on emacs it
;; self. For this pure and fully power imagination, I thought about sets
;; of hacking methods, through the way of 'sh-render' each xml or html
;; file within ebook as the melpa package [[https://github.com/wasamasa/nov.el][nov.el]] does, or using convert
;; way for as that transfer each ebook's internal ebook page to org
;; file. Obviously, the first one have the exits extension does, thus
;; this package was serving as the latter goal.  
;;
;;
;; Although kinds of ebook wrapper format are popular covering the word,
;; e.g. epub, awz3, mob ..., there's just the wrapper =epub= gets the
;; free for. Thus this package only given the try for converting the
;; epub format ebook to Org files collection ([[https://orgmode.org/][Org]] was the most popular
;; rich plain text format using in emacs).
;;
;;
;;
;; =entropy-epub2org= using four steps to process the convertting
;; procedure:
;;
;; 1) Unzip the epub file to the folder archived with sets of webpages
;;   which were the main contents host files.
;;
;; 2) Parsing the index part tree into org files.
;;
;; 3) Convert all content carrier file into org files named as is.
;;
;; 4) Tidy up all converted org files into the normal org context format.
;;
;;
;;;; Dependencies 
;;
;; this package depends on some external cli dependencies:
;; - [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]]
;; - unzip
;; - dos2unix
;;
;; Above two external cli tool unzip and dos2unix were common embedded
;; into various linux distribution, if not as, you should download them
;; using dist's package managements tool from the corresponding package
;; repository or from the DVD iso.
;;
;; For WINDOWS platform, I suggested using Msys2 to be the GNU
;; environment emulator which commonly embedded unzip and dos2unix as
;; well into it's installation, if not using Msys2's package management
;; =pacman= to install them.
;;
;; Pandoc was cross-platform tool using for providing various file type
;; converted each ohter, as thus support webpage source file converted
;; into Org file. In generally case that you should download and install
;; it manually from it's official website (mentioned in above list).
;;
;;
;;;; Requirements
;;
;; - entropy-common-library
;; - entropy-common-library-const
;; - entropy-unfill
;; - org
;; - files
;;
;; All the library named using the prefix =entropy-= was embedded into
;; [[https://github.com/c0001/entropy-emacs][entropy-emacs]], you can find them there and then download it into your
;; load path.
;;
;;;; Installation
;;
;; Just require it as:
;;: (require 'entropy-epub2org) 
;;
;;;; Interaction
;;
;;=entropy-epub2org= was easy to start it with calling only one func
;;~entropy/ep2o-dispatcher~ which one shabby(currently simplify used as)
;; and enough for walking through all the functionally.
;;
;; This func was interactively only for as. The once you call it, it
;; prompt you to choose the ebook location which will be chosen about,
;; and then unzip it for following steps processing mentioned in the
;; preamble.
;;
;; Just try to calling it as the first experience ^^:)
;;
;;;; Modification before/after converting
;;
;; For generally attempts for, not all content transfer from ebook source
;; to org format were comprehensively as what be along with your
;; expection. In this case, you wish to re-converted them agian for using
;; some modification rule using for ~entropy/ep2o-tidy-up-all-org-files~
;; which was the core tidy func using in step 'tidy up', of cousrse you
;; can use hook =entropy/ep2o-tidy-hook= to retry as the yet another way.
;;
;; The core aspects of 'tidy up' procedure was searching replacing the
;; unexpected converted content into the expected one following the
;; regexp rule list =entropy/ep2o-replace-rule-alist= whose each element
;; was the cons whose the car was the unexpected thing regexp matching
;; for, and the cdr otherwise. =entropy/ep2o-replacing-rule-alist= have
;; the default value setted for commonly useing in the first converted
;; processing but was absolutely limited of be that can not do with
;; widely unexpected occurrence, thus you can order extra rules by
;;~add-to-list~ as is for responding to the customized way. This
;; paragraph gives the way for ordering the specified modification before
;; converting.
;;
;; But as the human's imagination limitation, thus you couldn't get the
;; comprehensive looking for all the modification cases, you need to make
;; the modification process after the intial converting for generally
;; speaking. In this case you should using func
;; ~entropy/ep2o-src-adjusting-manually~ to modify the rest unexpected
;; thing have got. all you need was for inputting extra searching
;; replacing rule set once or repeatly for as with prompting it's
;; interface, thus til the state expected by your self.

;;;; ncx file parsing
;;
;; The first thing for convert epub format files sets to org sets was to
;; extracting the summary of it and convert it to be as org index file.
;;
;; The whole index of one epub sets was contained in one 'xml' file which
;; always named with the file extention as 'ncx' like 'toc.ncx'.
;;
;; Following function or library was aimed for extract the 'DOM' object
;; as one list and then parsing them into the tree headline string that
;; as usually doing of commonly org file operation.
;;
;; The 'DOM' extracting from the 'ncx' file was really simple, and can be
;; focus on one object ---'navPoint' object.
;;
;; 'navPoint' object can be self-contained for presenting the hierarchy
;; of the book's summary which consistencies can be shown as the follow
;; diagram:
;;
