#+title: Entropy org html export theme
#+author: Entropy


Org mode (emacs org mode) has the functional func
=org-html-export-as-html= which has the internal css and js decoration
for default exporting using. But this not enough for someone with the
mordern taste of web ui for his exporting visual style.

The internal default theme style:

#+attr_org: :width 400px

Using extra self building theme (with inhibiting internal theme
setting):

#+attr_org: :width 400px
[[file:annex/img/screenshot_2018-12-04_20-41-30.png]]
