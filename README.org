* Commentary:

The shell popuped feature provision what seems like the =vscode
shellpopup aspect=.

Allow =multi-shell-type= coexistence, that the mode-type of
=eshell-mode=, =shell-mode=, =term-mode= can be popuped together
with keybinding customization.

Allow =multi-shell-buffer= coexistence independently, with
completion query prompt manangement.

This package was inspired by [[http://github.com/kyagi/shell-pop-el][shell-pop-el]], but built based on
purely fundamental, for optimizing features' detailes and
restructed the popup feature rely on [[https://github.com/wasamasa/shackle][shackle]].

* Configuration:

Just cloning this repo under the path sepcified on your wish, and
added it to your ~load-path~, using ~require~ or ~use-package~ to
manage the configuration for this by calling the main function
