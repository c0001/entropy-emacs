For see full documents of the introduction of =entropy-emacs= please
see [[file:elements/site-lisp/entropy-emacs-doc/org/entropy-emacs_introduction.org][here]].

*Extensions:*

=entropy-emacs= using various third-party extensions from [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/][elpa]], [[https://melpa.org][melpa]],
and some ones hosted on _gihtub.com_, thus most of them are not
wrapped within this repo, for reason of module aspect
management. There's one main corresponding project tied with
=entropy-emacs= for as the archive of current using extensions
collection: ([[https://github.com/c0001/entropy-emacs-extensions][entropy-emacs-extensions]]), for see its explicit meaning,
see the commentary of [[file:elements/core/baron/summon/entropy-emacs-ext.el][entropy-emacs-ext.el]], and it's the
stable(tested) extensions that entropy-emacs used for, it has its own
host-server procedure which forked from '[[https://melpa.org/][melpa]]' to produce as what it
means. You must make it before using it and make understanding by
following its README or just install its stable release using the
~make~ section of =eemacs= (see the make eemacs secion below).

For case using by self downloading =entropy-emacs-extension= in a
released =entropy-emacs=, there's a version limit restriction usage
for this case that each eemacs release was followed a version of
=entropy-emacs-extension= release or the release referred updates
version follow the "x.y.z" version naming convention, you should
download the =entropy-emacs-extension= release which case this case
specified.

Or on the most used occasion, you don't need to retrieve that eemacs
extension release project, just using the melpa *up-to-date* upstream
but may have compatible problem with current eemacs release version,
if that, please using eemacs git repo as your eemacs configuration
workspace host to track update with =dev= branch, this may solve
various compatible issue or kick one issue on [[https://github.com/c0001/entropy-emacs/issues][eemacs issue page]] for
querying/asking on a resolution.

For switch this two extension usage type, the variable
~entropy/emacs-ext-elpkg-get-type~ are gives for you, the default type
was using melpa upstream to give the default ignorance to
=entropy-emacs-extension= manually download trouble, but in this case
should notice the above mentioned compatible issues.

Current =entropy-emacs-extensions= release version required: =1.0.1=

*Make entropy-emacs*

entropy-emacs use makefile to initialize with rich facilities for the
sake of stick on eemacs internal mechanism.

You can run ~make help~ to see the details.
